*DISCLAIMER*
The purpose of this application is to help track debt and inform users. This is not financial advice. 
The math used to calculate the minimum payments is a "universal" formuala found below. Some companies use a "floor payment", so the amount displayed may be more than displayed. 
If you'd like more information, visit the Chase website listed in the References Section.

The formula used to calculate the Minimum Monthly Payment is: 
	Interest		 Principal
((APR / 12) * Debt Amount) + (Debt Amount * 0.02)
